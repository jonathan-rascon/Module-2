# VBA-challenge
In this challenge we used VBA scripting to analyse generated stock market data.
A script that loops through all stocks and outputs the total yearly change, percent change, and stock volume for each ticker at the end of each month was created.
Then, a functionality was added to the script to print which Ticker had the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and the greatest total volume.
This script analysis works for all three years in each sheet and it can also work with way bigger data and more sheets.

According to our analysis,
for 2018, ticker THB had the greatest percent increase, RKS had the greatest decrease, and QKN the most volume.
for 2019, ticker RYU had the greatest percent increase, RKS had the greatest decrease, and ZQD the most volume.
for 2020, ticker YDI had the greatest percent increase, VNG had the greatest decrease, and QKN the most volume.

RKS had the greatest percent decrease for two consequtive years, 2018 and 2019.
Buying multiple PUT Options for RKS in 2017 would have been a very profitable investment.
